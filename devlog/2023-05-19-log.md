# Third day of workshop

# Craft

- Spent the whole morning finishing the Sheep sea slug and a new clione
- We tried to scan some elements with PolyCam and PhotoCatch
- Flore went outside to collect some moss
- LÃ©onie tried hot glue on fabric and fold it
- We discussed about the size and the organisation of the maquette

# Unity

- In the afternoon, we followed a first introduction to Unity
- We had a small debrief with Douglas and Pierre. They said we have to think about if our creatures need or don't need to be articulated/if we scan them separately/if they move or not/etc... Douglas suggested we think more about the stylisation of paper for our birds' skeleton (see: https://pinaffo-pluvinage.com).
