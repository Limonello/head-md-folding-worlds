# Vulnerabilis

Each year, cliones need to leave the ocean and cross the earth to give birth. They need to avoid birds, their mortal predators, to reach a pound in which their egg will be safe. But this year seems unusually calm with birds remains all along the way. Cliones have different roles in this mission and you embody different sentinels (one at the time). You have to light the area with your body in order for you friend carrying the egg to be able to pursue their way to the pound safely. Only one clione can light up at the time so don't switch too fast or your friend will stay, paralyzed by the fear, behind, in the dark.
