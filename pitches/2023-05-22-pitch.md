# Vulnerabilis

You are a clione. Each year, you and your family need to leave the ocean and cross the earth, carrying and protecting together a single egg. You need to avoid birds, your mortal predators, to reach a pound in which your egg will be safe. But this year seems unusually calm with birds remains all along the way. You start your journey to transmit life with your group, connected by the urge to give birth. Each member of the group has to scrutinize only one part of the environment. It's together that you can see everything around you. While going to the pound, a question remains: what if some birds were still alive ?
