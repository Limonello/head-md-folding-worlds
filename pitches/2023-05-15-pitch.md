You are a clione. Each year, you and your family need to leave the ocean and cross the earth, avoiding birds, your mortal predators, to reach a pound in which your eggs will be safe. But this year seems unusually calm with bird remains all along the way. You start your journey to transmit life with your group, connected by the urge to give birth. Some of them will die, some not, some others will follow a different path. While going to the pound, a question remains: what if some birds were still alive ?
