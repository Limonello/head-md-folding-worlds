# Vulnerabilis

You are a clione. Each year, you and your family need to leave the ocean and cross the earth to give birth. You need to avoid birds, your mortal predators, to reach a pound in which your egg will be safe. But this year seems unusually calm with birds remains all along the way. Cliones have different roles in this mission and you are part of sentinels. You have to check the area in order for you friends carrying the eggs to be able to pursue their way to the pound safely. But don't rush or your friends will stay stuck behind.
