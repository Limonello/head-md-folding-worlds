## Pitch

You are a clione. Each year, you and your family need to leave the ocean and cross the earth to give birth. You need to avoid birds, your mortal predators, to reach a pound in which your egg will be safe. But this year seems unusually calm with birds remains all along the way. Cliones have different roles in this mission and you are part of sentinels. You have to check the area in order for you friends carrying the eggs to be able to pursue their way to the pound safely. But don't rush or your friends will stay stuck behind.


## Synopsis

You are a sentinel and you see a new emerging clione carrying an egg (CCAE).

You are shining while the CCAE floats in direction to the pond. CCAE emits a soft sound.

When CCAE leaves your light area, she freezes on place, starts shaking and cry.

This is the moment where you have to pass to an other sentinel with your hand. One plate hand and the other one slides on a side on it.

You are in the second sentinel, you starts to shine again, while the first one is shuting down, and CCAE starts to move again.

You have to continue this way to reach the pond.

When you arrive at it, you see CCAE dive into water, mission accomplished.

You hear a new sound which comes from the beginning, maybe an other one is waiting for you to carry her...


## Visual Interaction Loop

Our fundamental interaction would be having the possibility to switch from one sea angel's point of view to another. To achieve this, you'll have to make a hand gesture in the direction of the sea angel you want to "switch" with. The hand gesture would be the word "walking past" in french sign language. We still don't know yet how this interaction would be suitable for a VR experience since the idea would be to have a limited vision of the area and therefore having to switch point of view to see everything.

## POV

- Sea angel 1: floats, shine when you embody her, shut down when you do not. Can pass to an other with sign. 
- Sea angel 2: floats, shine when you embody her, shut down when you do not. Can pass to an other with sign. 
- Sea angel 3: floats, shine when you embody her, shut down when you do not. Can pass to an other with sign. 
- Sea angel 4:  floats, shine when you embody her, shut down when you do not. Can pass to an other with sign.
