## Pitch

You are a clione. Each year, you and your family need to leave the ocean and cross the earth, carrying and protecting together a single egg. You need to avoid birds, your mortal predators, to reach a pound in which your egg will be safe. But this year seems unusually calm with birds remains all along the way. You start your journey to transmit life with your group, connected by the urge to give birth. Each member of the group has to scrutinize only one part of the environment. It's together that you can see everything around you. While going to the pound, a question remains: what if some birds were still alive ?

## Synopsis

You emerge from water, you embody the north clione. You are surrounded by your 3 other companions. Together, you carry one egg.

Then, you start to move automatically on this scary island.
You have to go toward the pond to give birth.

You are weak, but each of you is dedicated to make the egg survive, this is why you regulary change your point of view, just to make sure that the danger isn't coming from anywhere.

Traveling accross the island, you hear terrifying noises and encounter many stressing situations: some skeletons are falling, you see floating feather's from your predators and hear noises from them. However, none of them were alive.

Your travel finish in the pond where you can finally give birth and accomplish your mission.

## Visual Interaction Loop

Our fundamental interaction would be having the possibility to switch from one sea angel's point of view to another. To achieve this, you'll have to make a hand gesture in the direction of the sea angel you want to "switch" with. The hand gesture would be the word "walking past" in french sign language. We still don't know yet how this interaction would be suitable for a VR experience since the idea would be to have a limited vision of the area and therefore having to switch point of view to see everything.

## POV

- Sea angel 1: floats, glued back to back to their siblings, facing north
- Sea angel 2: floats, glued back to back to their siblings, facing east
- Sea angel 3: floats, glued back to back to their siblings, facing south
- Sea angel 4: floats, glued back to back to their siblings, facing west
