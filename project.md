## Pitch

You are a clione. Each year, you and your family need to leave the ocean and cross the earth, carrying and protecting together a single egg. You need to avoid birds, your mortal predators, to reach a pound in which your egg will be safe. But this year seems unusually calm with birds remains all along the way. You start your journey to transmit life with your group, connected by the urge to give birth. Each member of the group has to scrutinize only one part of the environment. It's together that you can see everything around you. While going to the pound, a question remains: what if some birds were still alive ?

## Synopsis

This is a "1 pager" that explains all the basics in one page. This is a text-based description of the project with maybe one illustration that accompagnies the text.

## Visual Interaction Loop

Our fundamental interaction would be having the possibility to switch from one sea angel's point of view to another. To achieve this, you'll have to make a hand gesture in the direction of the sea angel you want to "switch" with. The hand gesture would be the word "walking past" in french sign language. We still don't know yet how this interaction would be suitable for a VR experience since the idea would be to have a limited vision of the area and therefore having to switch point of view to see everything.

## POV

- Sea angel 1: floats, glued back to back to their siblings, facing north
- Sea angel 2: floats, glued back to back to their siblings, facing east
- Sea angel 3: floats, glued back to back to their siblings, facing south
- Sea angel 4: floats, glued back to back to their siblings, facing west
